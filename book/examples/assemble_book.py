assemble_book.py

Concatenates "Agentic Geodesic Lair Design for Supervillains" -- front
matter, all 24 chapters, and the three appendices, in reading order --
into a single Markdown file, then (by default) renders that file to PDF
AND EPUB via pandoc. `outline.md` is deliberately excluded: it's this
project's internal planning document, never reader-facing, and was never
part of the book itself. The PDF's title page shows, top to bottom:
title, subtitle, author, book/title-page-image.png (if present), then
edition. The EPUB gets the same title/author metadata and that same
image as its cover (if present), but not the PDF's seven-part \\part{}
divider structure -- see render_epub()'s docstring for why.

Reading order is: title_page.md, dedication.md, about_the_series.md,
how_to_use_this_book.md, ai_use_statement.md, chapter-01 through
chapter-24 (sorted by filename, which sorts correctly since every
chapter number is zero-padded), then appendix-a, appendix-b, appendix-c
(alphabetical, which is also their intended reading order). This mirrors
the identical script (and identical reasoning) in this series' companion
volume, `omen-agentic-time-series-forecasting/book/examples/assemble_book.py`
-- adapted here for this book's own title, 24-chapter/7-part structure,
and lack of a separate about_the_author.md.

Every chapter links its images with a path relative to this directory's
parent (e.g. `examples/images/class3-secret-lair.png`, written as if the
chapter file itself lives directly in book/). Concatenating files from
different directories into one output file breaks that relative path
unless it's rewritten to be relative to the assembled file's own new
location instead -- this script does that rewrite automatically, so the
assembled Markdown's images resolve correctly regardless of --out.

Usage:
    python assemble_book.py                  # writes dist/pylair-book.{md,pdf,epub}
    python assemble_book.py --out DIR         # writes to a different directory
    python assemble_book.py --skip-pdf        # skip the PDF (still writes EPUB)
    python assemble_book.py --skip-epub       # skip the EPUB (still writes PDF)

Requires nothing extra for the Markdown output. The PDF step requires
pandoc plus a working LaTeX engine (xelatex by default -- pass
--pdf-engine to use a different one); the EPUB step requires only pandoc
itself. If pandoc isn't on PATH, this script says so plainly for
whichever step needed it and still leaves the Markdown file (and any
other output that didn't need pandoc) written, rather than failing the
whole run.
